This is a web page where I will be able to show my self to the world, share some of the work I am doing and let people get in touch with me.

1. The first thing I did was to create the index page where my basic info will be. I used bootstrap to create a simple grid system with a couple of headings, paragraphs and a list. Also I added a footer and an image.
2. I created the contact form. For this I used bootstrap to get the code on the input for the user and added a botton. I also used the grid system.
3. I created the portfolio using images and a more complex grid system. Through the grid system I used I managed to create a responsive design for several screens.

This is a work in progress so update will be done regularly.
